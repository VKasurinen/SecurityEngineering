## Task 1: Lock-ins

Vendor lock in is related to the fact that the customer commits to using only one supplier's products and this often happens with cloud services, for example, which can lead to unnecessary cost escalation. If a company wants to change cloud service provider, then it may be expensive, because everything has to be changed to another service and it involves a lot of work. 

Technological lock in is when a company commits to using only a certain technology. It can be, for example, a code language or a farmework. This can cause compatibility problems over time as the technology develops, and switching to another solution can cause more costs. 

I don't have a lot of experience with this type of situation, but in this industry, this type of situation is often related to cloud services. I personally recommend that services be distributed. For example, I have made an application where I took server space from the Google Cloud Run service where I was able to put the backend running and the data storage from Mongodb Atlas, so I distributed these separately.

## Task 2: Security Psychology

## Why are phishing attacks effective enough to be widespread practice? 

Phishing tactics work because they use familiar patterns that people use almost every day. From a cognitive perspective, people process a lot of information in their daily lives and this can tire them, and at the same time they rely on quick thinking rules. For example, when an email comes from their own bank, people tend to trust superficial clues, such as logos and the official tone of the text. From a social perspective, phishing exploits social trust, for example, when a message comes from a respected source, people naturally perceive it as trustworthy. The feeling of threat can also play a role. For example, when an email comes that says "Your account will be closed immediately," it creates a sense of urgency and you have to act immediately. 


## Why social engineering works on people? 

People generally tend to trust others and follow norms because it is usually beneficial. A manipulator can build trust, for example, by presenting a familiar person, causing the target to act according to certain behavioral patterns. If the target is rushed or stressed, people will resort to routines and habits, which reduces their ability to think critically. Another classic example is in the business world, if you receive an email saying "IT support tells you to do X," people naturally obey authority more easily. 


## Why many people have hard time using passwords in secure way? 

Secure passwords often require complexity, length, variation and special characters. The human mind is really bad at remembering random strings, so users easily end up choosing familiar passwords from real life and use them in many places. From a cognitive perspective, the human working memory capacity is 3-7 units on average, so it is really difficult for the human mind to remember a random string of numbers. For example, a phone number is much easier to remember because it can be retrieved from storage memory to be passed to working memory and its size is 3-4 units. e.g. 044 862 22 12. From a social perspective, you can say the classic "Everyone else uses easy passwords too". 


## Why it is so easy to spread malware? 

Malware works because they exploit people's social weaknesses. People often fall for this because it is really attractive and creates a sense of urgency. For example, "You are the 100th visitor to this page, win a free iPhone." In this case, people click on the links and possibly download malware. Malware also spreads between people if people share links with each other in their circle of friends. People trust friends and they are more likely to click on links from them.

## Task 3A: Intellectual Rights

### Intellectual Property (IP)
A broad concept that covers all intangible property such as copyrights and patents 

### Copyright
Protects creative work such as text, music, software or images without a separate application for permission. An example would be Disney, which protects its films from unauthorized copying. 

### Patent
Protects a technical invention for a predetermined period of time, usually about 20 years, preventing others from exploiting it. For example, Polar Elektron's "Heart rate monitor" patent that protects the design of a wristwatch. 

### Trademark
Protects distinctive signs such as logos, names or slogans. For example, the Coca-Cola logo and the shape of the bottle. 

### Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)
A non-disclosure agreement in which the parties agree to keep certain information confidential and if it is violated, they contain very large compensation amounts as a fine. They are widely used in the business world when making agreements. 

### Watermarks
They are invisible or visible stamps on images, documents or videos that indicate their origin. 

### Software Licenses
Regulate the rights to use the software, i.e. what can and cannot be done. For example, Microsoft office software can only be used in accordance with the terms of the license. 

### Digital Rights Management (DRM)
A technology that restricts the copying and sharing of digital content. Spotify uses this to prevent unauthorized copying of music 

### Software Protection Dongles
Physical USB keys or similar devices that are required to use the software.

## Task 3B: Freedom of Information

In the past, hacker groups have often cracked DRM protections on the Internet. Ordinary consumers have also used programs that could remove copy protection so that content could be viewed and listened to without restrictions. This was done because DRM unreasonably restricts users' rights, for example by transferring music to their own device or by preventing use on devices where it is not supported. Many people believe that circumventing DRM is not piracy but a way to fully utilize purchased content. 

Another example could be in the early days of the corona pandemic. In northern Italy, there was a shortage of ventilator valves, which were needed for life-sustaining treatment. The manufacturer of the valve had patent protection for this and the supply of these could not keep up with the crisis, so local engineers decided to 3D print the spare parts themselves. The patent was circumvented because it was an emergency and patients were dying without valves and the manufacturer itself could not keep up with the demand. The moral weight was much greater than the legal risk. At this point, volunteers and hospitals saw that action was necessary.
